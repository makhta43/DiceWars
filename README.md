# DiceWars

This is a fully working game created in Java with GUI using swing.
The app is somewhat a close of a web game called DiceWars.
The game is played locally and has coded implementation for maps being loaded in through .CSV.
By default each game will have a randomly generated map created.
There is no AI implementation so can only be played using local multiplayer with at least 2 players.
